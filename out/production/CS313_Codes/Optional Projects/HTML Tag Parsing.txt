Write a program that reads an HTML file and ensures that HTML tags are correctly matched.  An example HTML tag is p, which marks a paragraph and consists of an opening tag, <p> and a closing tag </p>.  This problem is similar to the problem of checking for matched parentheses/brackets, and you may utilize the code from lecture 9 and modify it as needed.  Since there are many different types of tags, it may serve to make your program match any general tags of the form <SomeTag> â€¦ </SomeTag>, rather than coding a separate case for each possible tag.  Caution: Some HTML tags do not have a closing tag, such as <meta> tags, <br> tags, and comments, which are written as <!-- comment --> in HTML.  Textbook p. 236 - 237 may provide some additional insights.
