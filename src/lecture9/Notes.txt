Stacks

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows a last in, first out (LIFO) access pattern.

Stack ADT
void push(E)
E pop()

//for convenience:
E top(), or E peek()
int size()
Boolean isEmpty()

Array-based implementation
LinkedList-based implementation

Homework:

 
1 - In the lecture we implement a Stack using an array.  Implement a Stack using an ArrayList. Are there any advantages to
the ArrayList implementation over an array? (done)

 
 
2 - Write a boolean method that uses a Stack to determine if a String is a palindrome (a palindrome is a String that
reads the same forwards and backwards, i.e. “racecar”).  Hint: There are multiple ways to do this, but the simplest is
to loop through the String twice.
