Write a method that takes a String representing an arithmetic expression, such as “1 + 2 * 3”, and returns a Double value representing the value resulting from the expression.  You may utilize the PostfixParsing program from lecture 10 and modify it as needed. Thus, the crux of the problem will be converting from traditional arithmetic notation (aka “infix”) to postfix notation.  This is a well known problem that is solved by the shunting-yard algorithm, which utilizes a Stack (and optionally a Queue).
